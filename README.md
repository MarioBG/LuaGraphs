<h1>LuaGraphs, a graphs library for Lua</h1>
<p>This library is intended for its use with ComputerCraft, the Minecraft mod by Dan200 (Daniel Ratcliffe). It provides the necessary tools to create directed and undirected graphs, along with an implementation of the A* algorithm. Please refer to the documentation for more instructions.</p>
<p>The library is contained within the LuaGraphs.lua file. The rest are for a practical application, more specifically a pathfinding program for ComputerCraft's pocket computers in a specific Minecraft map.</p>
